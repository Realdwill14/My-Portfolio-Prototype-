          <p>As a designer, my skill sets in Adobe applications are Illustrator, Photoshop and Indesign. I am still learning how to use Adobe After Effects and Premier Pro as I am new to the applications. I am always willing to perfect my craft. </p>
          <p> I am able to create logos, banners, flyers, business cards and more for small and big companies or businesses or individual clients and for people who are gamers and streamers on whichever platform they stream on.</p>

            <img src="images/Williams-BWbase.jpg" alt="Coway Airmega Air Purifier">
            <p> From previous semesters ago, I created this product for a product advertisement project when I was taking a technical illustration class. 
                This is a product that helps with having a better breathing environment in your own home. It helps with detecting bad air pollution around inside your home.
                Also has several control buttons of how to properly operate the air purifier in the best way possible. It is mainly for older and elderly people who struggle with breathing clearly and health issues. Overall this is a design product I created in Illustrator.

            <p> I created this project in Graphic Design 3, a few semesters ago. I created this label design in Illustrator called REBOOT which is an energy drink made for gamers and streamers to keep them energized and refreshed while they play and stream video games, so they can play to their best potential.</p>

            <p> This is a project that I did with a group of people from my Client Relations class a semester ago. This was for a client we did for her own business that she created along with others that work with her called the "ThrivingTwentySomethings". For my part of the role, I was responsible for creating a Sign Up template and I created this in Canva and Illustrator. If you would like to know more about her business, go check out her website! <a href="http:/https://www.thrivingtwentysomethings.com/"
